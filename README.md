# Heirloom Shuffleboards
This project was created for a client who had an existing website that she wanted redesigned. I wanted to make her site look more modern as well as making her site responsive. Another goal of this project was to make it easy for my client to add new table models and images as she expands her business. Using JSON, my client can easily add or remove the tables as she pleases. Various other information can also be modified using JSON.
